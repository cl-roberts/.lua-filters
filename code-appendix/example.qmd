This filter moves the source code generating the following text

```{r}
to_end <- "move source code to an appendix please, thx"

to_end
```

as well as this plot

```{r}
plot(mtcars[,c("mpg", "cyl")])
```


to an appendix at the end of the document, (but keeps the output in its usual place).
Force a page break in the `.qmd` to display appendix on separate page.

{{< pagebreak >}}
