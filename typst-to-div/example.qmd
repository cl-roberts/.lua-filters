The standard way to run `.qmd` content through custom typst styling appears to 
be to wrap said content in typst blocks, e.g.

```{=typst}
#block(
    fill:luma(230), 
    inset:16pt,
    outset:-8pt, 
    radius:4pt,
    [
```

...quarto content...

```{=typst}
    ]   
) 
```

This lua filter allows users to create typst functions in a `typst-template.typ`
file (or just the `.qmd`) and call them from a Quarto div:

```{=typst}

#let myblock(text) = block(text,
    fill:luma(230), 
    inset:16pt,
    outset:-8pt, 
    radius:4pt
  )
```

::: {.typst-to-div-myblock}
...quarto content...
:::

Note that the div class is named using the user-created typst 
function name preceded by the project name as determined as the parent directory
to the `_extensions` folder and an `'-'`. In this example's case, the typst function 
is `myblock` and the `_extentions` folder lives in a parent directory called 
`typst-to-div`. Hence, to call the typst function I used a div with class
`.typst-to-div-myblock`
